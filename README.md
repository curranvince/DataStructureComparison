# DataStructureComparison
A comparison of insert/search times for different Data Structures

In this project, I made several different data structures, which include a Linked List,
Binary Search Tree, and three different Hash Tables, one implementing Linear Probing, 
one Quadractic Probing, and the other with Chaining. The results of the tests are
graphed in the FinalReport pdf file.

*A note about accuracy: The first insert/search graph for the Binary Search Tree is slightly
inaccurate. It should be shaped more like the second graph of the BST. I believe this 
problem was due to not running the tests enough times before averaging the data and
creating the graphs.
